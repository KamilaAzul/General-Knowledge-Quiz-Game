## UX Strategy

Game is designed using Python default view in black screen.

<br/> 

### The Business Goals of the Website:
- Website does' commercial goals, but the site's goal is to provide an interactive quiz.
  
  <br/> 

### The Target Customer:

- The audience of the site could encompass a number of age groups and there would generally not be any   limitation on who could not play.   
       
- Would probably require some access to digital technology(not mobile).      
- May be useful for a user who has spare time and enjoys football.
